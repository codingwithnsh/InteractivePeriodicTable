# Interactive Periodic Table Viewer

The **Interactive Periodic Table Viewer** is a Python application that provides a fun and educational experience for users to explore the periodic table. It is designed to help students, educators, and anyone interested in chemistry to learn about the elements interactively. The application presents a colorful, properly arranged periodic table and dynamically visualizes the atomic structure of each element.

## Features
- **Interactive Table**: Click on any element to view its detailed properties.
- **Electron Configuration Visualization**: Display the atom's nucleus and shells with revolving electrons.
- **Color-Coded Categories**: Elements are categorized and color-coded for easy identification (e.g., noble gases, transition metals).
- **Educational Tooltips**: Learn about elements' atomic number, category, and electron configuration.

## Technology Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter
- **Math Library**: For rendering electron orbits around the nucleus.

## Usage

### Step-by-Step Guide
Follow these steps to use the **Interactive Periodic Table Viewer**:

1. **Run the Application**:
   - Execute the Python script to open the interactive periodic table:
     ```bash
     python maine.py
     ```

2. **Explore the Periodic Table**:
   - A colorful periodic table will appear on the screen.
   - Click on any element to reveal its details, including:
     - Name and symbol
     - Atomic number
     - Element category (e.g., noble gas, alkali metal)
     - Electron configuration

3. **Visualize Atomic Structure**:
   - When clicking on an element, a visualization of its nucleus and electron shells will appear on the right side of the window.
   - The electrons revolve dynamically around the nucleus.

4. **Learn Through Categories**:
   - Elements are color-coded based on their categories:
     - **Nonmetals**: Light Blue
     - **Noble Gases**: Gold
     - **Alkali Metals**: Orange
     - **Alkaline Earth Metals**: Lime Green
     - **Transition Metals**: Tomato Red
     - **Lanthanides and Actinides**: Pink and Brown
     - **Metalloids and Post-Transition Metals**: Purple and Sky Blue

5. **Close the Application**:
   - When you're done exploring, simply close the application window.
